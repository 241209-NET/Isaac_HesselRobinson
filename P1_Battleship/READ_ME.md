You can play the classic game battleship, though only the shooting part.
Your opponent will randomly place 5 ships on their grid. When prompted, guess a grid in the format LetterNumber (eg, A1, G6, etc). Letters cannot exceed J, and numbers cannot exceed 10.
If the guess gridsquare contains any part of an enemy ship, you will be notified of a hit; otherwise, a miss. If it was the final un-hit grid square for that ship, you will be notified that you sunk the ship. You will win after sinking all enemy ships.

Stretchgoals:
-Place ships on your own grid
-AI that attemps to sink your ships
